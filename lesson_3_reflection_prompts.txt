When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For collborative work
When multiple users are working on the same master copy of the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It might be better off reviewing the changes done on the remote repository before pulling it to local repository.
