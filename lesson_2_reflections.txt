What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialization indicates that a new folder/files will be added to the version control.
This is required to ensure that the version control system is aware that new files are to be added.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
This is an intermediate location before doing a permanent commit to the repository.
The selective data can be pushed to the repository and being sure of moving it.
This gives a cleaner approach of what data that users want to push to repository instead of everything in the folder.
